See this for how the invite server was developed using perplexity.ai
  https://www.perplexity.ai/search/create-a-stand-alone-node-js-b-KEwKiNj8Rj26gO9frKQFAg

Need to have node v16 
  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash
  nvm install 16
  nvm use 16

To control the server:
  ./invite-server start         # default is port 5050
  ./invite-server start 5151    # specify the port
  ./invite-server stop          # stop the server
  ./invite-server restart       # restart the server
  

Make sure the firewall is open for the server port

Configureations are in the .env file

inv.liberdus.com is mapped to the IP of arimaa.com on CloudFlare
CloudFlare is set to Proxy inv.liberdus.com

CloudFlare is configured to use a HTTPS connection to inv.liberdus.com
  but the HTTPS certificate can be self signed. This is done by setting
  CloudFlate SSL/TSL origin server config to Full mode.

Self signed certificated created on June 19, 2025 and good for 10 years
  mkdir -p ssl
  openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out ssl/private.key
  openssl req -new -x509 -key ssl/private.key -out ssl/certificate.crt -days 3650
  Edit .env to use the certificate files in ssl directory

However CloudFlare only allows the origin server to run HTTPS on ports
443, 2053, 2083, 2087, 2096, 8443

We will run it on port 2083
./invite-server start 2083

Also have to open the firewall:
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=2083/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

Test from another computer like this:
wget https://inv.liberdus.com:2083/get/12345 --no-check-certificate -q --output-document=-
